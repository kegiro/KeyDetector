# KeyDetector 🚀

KeyDetector is a simple Rust-based key detection program that highlights pressed keys in the alphabet dynamically. It runs in the terminal and updates the display in real-time.

## ✨ Features
- Detects key presses **without waiting for Enter**.
- Highlights the pressed key in **red**.
- Clears and refreshes the screen **only when needed**.
- Works smoothly with **low latency (10ms checks)**.
- Press **Esc** to exit.

## 🛠 Installation
Make sure you have **Rust** installed. If not, install it with:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
